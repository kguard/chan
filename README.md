Now I get it

난 바람이다.
It's windy
나는 왜 안 됨?
난 됨
밥 머먹을까

If you just waitI can't

To those who are waiting

The wind is even stronger

It's just a rush

It's windy

It means to get through it

No matter who goes out and falls

It means to fight a game.

in life

There's nothing but wind

My walk

The whole road is a wind road.
